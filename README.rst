Basic tools to do things with VOEvents. 
(e.g. pick out certain events, then send email alerts or new VOEvents, etc.)


Installation:
-------------
From the command line::

 git clone git@github.com:timstaley/pysovo.git
 cd pysovo
 pip install .


Setup:
------

If you want to use the email alert facility, you should run::

 >$ python input_email_settings.py

This will prompt you for username, password, etc. You can mostly accept default
settings if using a gmail login. Note that the password input will not be
echoed to the terminal if running from a regular python interpreter, but it 
seems that ipython insists on displaying it for you. 
The details are saved under ``$HOME/.vo_alerts/email_acc``
and the file permissions are set so that only you have read access. Your password
will also be weakly obfuscated using base64 encoding. 

.. warning::

 The email routines have only been tested with Gmail- 
 the server handshake may need hacking at for other email services.


Testing:
--------
There are currently a few unit tests, try 
nosetests -svx from the ``pysovo`` package folder.

Also see the ``integration_tests`` folder - the easiest way to get these to 
run prior to installation is to use ipython from the root project folder, 
e.g. ::

  ipython integration_tests/sendmail_test.py


To do:
------
 - Implement email reading, for 2 way communication with AMI.
