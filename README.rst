fourpisky-core
===============

Basic tools to do things with VOEvents.
(e.g. pick out certain events, then send email alerts or new VOEvents, etc.)

Also encodes the key logic-flow behind the 4PiSky VOEvent hub, see
http://4pisky.org/voevents/ for background.

This codebase is not intended for general release, it is very much tailored
to our specific needs. However, it may serve as a reference for others.

For an example in the literature fourpisky being applied, see
`Staley et al (2012) <http://ukads.nottingham.ac.uk/abs/2012arXiv1211.3115S>`_.

Features
---------

- VOEvent filtering and custom actions
- Custom email notifications with site-reports for designated observatories
  (including calculated rise / set / transit times, etc)
- VOEvent creation to a standard template
- Reasonably complete test suite


Instructions
------------
There are none - this is not intended for general consumption and documentation
requires effort to maintain.
However, feel free to `contact me`_ 
with any questions.
